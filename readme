This project was developed by Joao Brito (joao.mano.brito@gmail.com).
The main purpose of this project is only personal. The reason is that I need to organize all my learning curve.
=======
This branch contains all the source code of several python features.
I'm using pydev in order to garantee that you will execute the python code in a correct manner.

In order to start run the tests you should execute:
source configure.sh 

Be carefull that you should run the configure.sh that is near to your folder (ex: /a/b/c/exec , run: source /a/b/configure.sh)
