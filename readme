This branch contains all the source code of several python features.
I'm using pydev in order to garantee that you will execute the python code in a correct manner.

In order to start run the tests you should execute:
source configure.sh 

Be carefull that you should run the configure.sh that is near to your folder (ex: /a/b/c/exec , run: source /a/b/configure.sh)
